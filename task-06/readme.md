This was a highly time consuming task for me, I spent a lot of days on scraping data and building the discord bot.I initially went to the given website and understood that the data given at the top is to be scraped.But I was unsure whether the data will change as the match changes.I thought there was a possibility that the data I scrape would be related to that particular match and would only scrape that data.So I first scraped the link of the match shown first and went into that site and scraped data from there.It was a long process and I faced many issues in getting the data.So I decided to take the data from the given website and go to my initial plan only if any error happend.So I scraped data from first website and it worked.Building the bot was easier compared to this.When !livescore was recieved data will be scraped and message will be shown by the bot.But I did all of this in a single file.I didn't knew that it was possible to call functions in a python file from another python files.But later I tried doing it.I read about it in some websites and was able to make it into two different python files.I reffered geeks for geeks,stack overflow and many other websites for completing this task.
