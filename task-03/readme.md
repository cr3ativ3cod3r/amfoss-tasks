I only knew some begginner level python.So I started with python.It was easy to write it in python.After that I studied how to do the exact same thing in other languages.I learn't how to take input,print output,put loops,create list etc that was required to recreate the exact program in other languages.While moving on with the tasks I found some difficulties in recreating the exact same code.So i looked for another way and found out another method and used it to solve the task in rust and some other languages.I had python already installed in my system.For other languages I used online IDEs.

Ruby was easy to learn after completing python.Before starting javascript I had already completed Chrome Extension task, so the knowledge gained from that task helped me over here.Doing it in rust,haskell,elixir was the most difficult especially rust.Rust was entirely different from all the languages and I spent a lot of time figuring it out.In the case of elixir I wrote the code and tried to run it.But it was showing error and I was unable to identify the error.So i asked chatgpt if there was any error and it replied there wasn't any.Finally I ran it in other devices and it worked.Java was of moderate level but figuring out the errors took a lot of time.
Doing it in c,c++ was easy as both of them were almost similar.
