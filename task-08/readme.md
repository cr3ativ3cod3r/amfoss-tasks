I created a virtual enviornment and installed requirements.txt.My first aim was to fetch pokemon data when name was entered and search button was pressed.So I defined a function which will be called when submit button was clicked.In the function I added the input in the textbox to the url of poke-api and fetched data from it.Just like in the extension task I got the necessary data.Using settext I set that data (abilities,stats,etc) as data of labels which were initially defined by me.Using setgeometry I set the position of each label.To download image I imported os.I created a folder called store to save the images downloaded.Aother function was called when capture button was clicked.Which stored the image in the required file.When display was clicked the files in same folder was displayed in another window.The movement from one picture to another was made possible by assigning index values to the opened file and using previous,next buttons to move between them.Then I set the background and when the submit button was clicked I also changed the background to another for better readability.I copied the style sheet given in main.py for the buttons in search window also.
