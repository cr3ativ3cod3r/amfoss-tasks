Cracking the logic was somewhat an easy process.But writting the code was difficult.AS I was new to programming I got many syntax error.I copied the code and ran it on vscode, it was easier to find the errors in vscode.I got stuck in some problems.I revisited them after few days and was able to solve them.In some of the problems the code was failing some testcases.As the testcases weren't shown it was difficult troubleshooting them.The task helped to gain some more hold over python and it was also enjoyable.
