The html and css parts was easy to do because of the experience gained from building the website.I read about chrome extension making from google and understood that we need to create a .json file.So created one added the image that wanted to give to the extension and linked the html file.Then I turned on developer mode and loaded the .json file.Then I then created an input box and in an input class.I defined variables in javascript file, added an eventlistner(click) to fetch data when submit button is pressed.Then searched a random place in the extension,went to the console and found out the place where my required data was present.I stored the required data in variables and gave it to the html to display using innerhtml.Defined a class output and gave temperature,climate and city in it.I made the necessary position arrangements,font style etc with css.
